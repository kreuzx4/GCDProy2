#Test & Train files are stored in the following variables
sTest
xTest 
yTest 
sTrain
xTrain 
yTrain
features 

Columns are replaced with the names in features
xTrain contains de rowbinded data but is then stored in xVar with  all the data , we remove the previous variables
xvar
Variables removed: xTrain / xTest/ features

Subject data is created in sTrain & sTest
sTrain contains the rowbinded data , but is then stored in subs with all the data. we remove the previous variables
subs now has all the data , we remove the previous variables
Variables removed: sTrain / sTest

Activity data is created. 
Names are replaced in yTrain and yTest
yTrain contains the the rowbinded data , but is then stored in act with all the data. we remove the previous variables
act now has all the data , we remove the previous variables
Variables removed: yTrain / yTest

Activity Labels are replaced
A new column in act is created with "unset"
Numbers are replaced by the labels ("Walking" /  "Walking_Upstairs" / "Walking_Downstairs"/ "Sitting" / "Standing"
/"Laying")


xvar now contains all the data from subs & act

A new subset for the mean and STD is created. 
sMean contains all the columns that include "mean" in their name
sStd contains all the columns that include "std" in their name
sStd now contains the means and std, we need to add subject & activities by column bindin

dataset now contains all the information of the tidy data, the column name Activity is renamed
Variables removed:sStd

#Create & save a new dataset 
By melting and Casting by subject and activity we create a new dataset with the mean of all variables
Variables:
meltDataset - Contains melted data
finalDS - Creates the mean operation

the finalDS of the tidy data is printed into a txt file:"finalData.txt"
