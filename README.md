Proyect 2 of Getting and cleaning data

Test / Train & Features files are read
Features file is used to replace columns name
Test & Train files are added into the columns to create a dataset with all the data
Subject & Activity files are added into the data set
Labels for activities are added instead of the numbers
A new data set is created and with it we can procede to separate just the mean and std columns
Once we have just the columns where we need to make a calculation we melt and cast the data that gives us a file 
with all the means for each subject and variable
The file is printed as a text file separated by tabs.
